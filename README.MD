# App GITHUB Users

**Explanation**
This app is being developed with the purpose of practicing and studying new technologies, implementing things I'm not yet mastered, and also completing a challenge.

The idea is to create an app where users can log in with their github accounts, and add profiles to be able to look at repositories and information.
